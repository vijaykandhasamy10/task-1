1. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTML 1 AND HTML 2 :

  A website is simply a collection of web pages.For creating any webpages we require HTML.
       
           HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

 Nowadays it have five versions.Now i am blog about the differences of  Html 1 and Html 2.
       
       HTML 1.0

     - The basic version of  HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images.

     - It does not have rich features like styling and other things that were related to how content
       will be rendered in a browser.
    
     - The initial version of  HTML does not provide support for tables,font support,etc..

       HTML 2.0

     -  It was developed in 1995 and also intention of improving HTML 1.0

     - Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common rules and regulations
       across different browsers.

     - In this version was developed in a lot of terms of the markup tags.Forms were developed 
       but still,they had basic tags like text boxes,buttons,etc..

      
2. OBJECT AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT :

      - Objects in javascript,is its most important data type and forms the building blocks for
         modern javascript.

      - These objects are quite different from javascript 's primitive  data-types(Number,
         string,Boolean,null,undefined and symbol)in the sense that while these primitive
         data types all store a single value each.

      - Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these
         primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

      - An object is a reference data type.variables that are assigned a reference value are
        given a reference or a pointer to that value.
